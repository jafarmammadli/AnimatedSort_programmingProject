Project Overview

-- This is an animated sorting visualizer that shows the sorting animation of  Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort in real-time.

-- I used tkinter for the GUI and canvas graphics, "random" for generating shuffled bars, and generator functions with yield to control animation.

-- The program has a select menu to select algorithms, a speed slider (1-67(don't ask why)) to adjust animation speed, and a "generate" button to create new random order.

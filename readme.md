Project Overview

-- This is an animated sorting visualizer that shows the sorting animation of  Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort in real-time.

-- I used tkinter for the GUI and canvas graphics, "random" for generating shuffled bars, and generator functions with yield to control animation.

-- The program has a select menu to select algorithms, a speed slider (1-67(don't ask why)) to adjust animation speed, and a "generate" button to create new random order.

-- You can download the project.py (and preferably adidas.png) and run with python project.py to test it.


Usage: 
It should be obvious but here it is:
- **GENERATE!** - Creates new random bars
- **Menu** - Select sorting algorithm
- **SPEED Slider** - Adjust animation speed (1=>slow, 67=>fast)
- **START SORT!** - Begin the animation
- **EXIT** - Close the program
